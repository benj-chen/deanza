i>20? "is greater than 20":"less than or equal to 20"

C++ guarantees the value of x to be 1, or true. This is because 8<n is evaluated first
because left first. 8<n is 0, or false. 0<7 or false<7 is true.

// 4

The printed value is 1. 10/7 is 1 and 1/3 is 0 because integer division truncates or
rounds down for positive numbers. 1+0 is 1.

char c = cin.get();
if (c=='\t') cout << "It is a tab" << endl;

The result is that there is an error when compiling. 18.5 is not a valid operand for %,
because it is a double. Modulus only works on integers.
